# React Application with Vite

This repository contains a React application built using Vite, a fast build tool for modern web development.

This Drag-and-Drop web application allows users to effortlessly organize and manage items through intuitive drag-and-drop functionality. With two drop zones conveniently positioned, one on the left and the other on the right, users can seamlessly move items between them and save the change afterward.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed before running the application:

- Node.js (v18.16.0 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

## Getting Started

To run the React application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/CkhGueye/drag-and-drop.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. Install the dependencies using npm:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

This will start the application and display the URL in the console (e.g., http://localhost:5173/). Open your web browser and visit this URL to view the application.

## Additional Information

- The `src` directory contains the source code for the React application.
- The `public` directory contains static assets such as HTML files and images.
- The `dist` directory will be created automatically when you build the application for production using the command `npm run build`.
